# Portfolio Optimization: Balancing Risk and Return

## Introduction
Portfolio optimization is a crucial concept for anyone involved in investing, whether you're a novice investor or a seasoned financial worker. Understanding how to balance risk and return can significantly impact your investment decisions.

## Basic Concepts of Investing
Before diving into the complex theories, let's cover some fundamental principles of investing:
- **Risk**: The potential for losing your investment.
- **Return**: The gain or profit you expect from an investment.
- **Diversification**: Spreading your investments to reduce risk.

## Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. It's based on the idea that an investor can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk.

### Key Equations
Here, we delve into the core mathematical equations of MPT. (Insert detailed mathematical explanations here).

## The Efficient Frontier
The Efficient Frontier is a crucial concept in MPT. It's a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.

### Mathematical Explanation
(Insert an in-depth mathematical explanation of the Efficient Frontier).

## NASDAQ Stock Examples
To illustrate these concepts, let's look at a couple of examples using NASDAQ stocks. (Insert brief stock examples and Python-generated graphs).

```python
# Python code for generating graph
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
